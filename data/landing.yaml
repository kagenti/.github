  title: Cloud-Native Control Plane for AI Agents
  subtitle: |
    Kagenti bridges the gap between powerful agent frameworks and production-grade deployments. Built on proven cloud-native technologies, it delivers secure lifecycle and identity management, robust configuration, fault tolerance, unified control for agentic tools, and built-in observability.

    Powered by Kubernetes, Kagenti simplifies infrastructure integration and agent lifecycle management through a dedicated Agent Operator. It enhances Kubernetes networking with an MCP-aware Gateway built on Envoy, and replaces static credentials with dynamic, SPIRE-managed identities—ensuring secure, continuous authentication across workflows.

    With Kagenti, teams can seamlessly transition from development to scalable, secure production environments for AI agents.

    - title: MCP Gateway
      icon: key
      description: MCP Gateway is a Kubernetes-native, Envoy-based gateway designed to streamline access to multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It leverages Kubernetes APIs like the MCPServer CRD for declarative server management, HTTPRoute integration for automatic backend discovery, and an operator that keeps your configuration in sync. With flexible policy support, including integration with Kuadrant or any Envoy-compatible policy engine, MCP Gateway empowers you to build scalable, secure, and policy-driven AI infrastructure with ease.

    - title: Identity and Tool Authorization Pattern
      icon: build
      description: Identity and Tool Authorization Pattern brings zero-trust security to the Agentic Platform by enforcing continuous authentication and fine-grained authorization for both human and machine identities. Built on SPIFFE/SPIRE and integrated with Keycloak, it replaces static credentials with dynamic, short-lived tokens, ensuring secure identity propagation and least-privilege access across services. Through structured token exchanges and real-time policy enforcement, this pattern enables secure delegation, robust machine identity management, and continuous verification—laying the foundation for scalable, production-ready agentic workflows.
