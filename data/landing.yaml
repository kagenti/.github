    An open source project aimed at showcasing interoperability of various cloud-native technologies for agentic platforms.

    Our primary focus are the following aspects:
    * [MCP Gateway](https://github.com/kagenti/mcp-gateway/blob/main/README.md)
    * [Identity and Authorization Management](https://github.com/kagenti/kagenti/blob/main/docs/demo-identity.md)
    * [Operators for Agent and Tool Life Cycle](https://github.com/kagenti/kagenti-operator/blob/main/README.md)
    * [Demos](https://github.com/kagenti/kagenti/blob/main/docs/demos.md)

  title: Cloud-native middleware for AI agents
  subtitle: |
    Kagenti bridges the gap between powerful agent frameworks and production readiness by providing secure identity management, configuration, fault tolerance, and persistence out of the box.

    Built on Kubernetes, Kagenti streamlines infrastructure integration and agent lifecycle management with a dedicated platform operator. It also replaces static credentials with dynamic, SPIRE-managed identities, ensuring secure, continuous authentication across workflows. With Kagenti, teams can move from development to scalable, secure production deployments of AI agents with ease.

    - title: Kubernetes Platform Operator
      icon: smart_toy
      description: The operator facilitates the deployment of new framework instances, supports the registration and scaling of multi-framework agents, and assists in setting up and configuring identity management and agents' authorizations.

    - title: API Key Propagation
      icon: key
      description: API Key propagation for MCP does not work out of the box. With modifications to the Llama Stack MCP provider and an opinionated use of the MCP Python SDK, we demonstrate that an API key can be propagated from a Llama Stack client to a MCP tool server.

    - title: Agent as MCP Tool
      icon: build
      description: This demo involves registering a CrewAI agent as a tool within the MCP framework. Once registered, the Llama Stack agent, configured with this tool, can utilize the CrewAI agent to conduct research on a given topic and provide a final result.
