  title: Cloud-native middleware for AI agents
  subtitle: |
    Kagenti bridges the gap between powerful agent frameworks and production readiness by providing secure identity management, configuration, fault tolerance, and persistence out of the box.

    Built on Kubernetes, Kagenti streamlines infrastructure integration and agent lifecycle management with a dedicated platform operator. It also replaces static credentials with dynamic, SPIRE-managed identities, ensuring secure, continuous authentication across workflows. With Kagenti, teams can move from development to scalable, secure production deployments of AI agents with ease.

      icon: key
      description: API Key propagation for MCP does not work out of the box. With modifications to the Llama Stack MCP provider and an opinionated use of the MCP Python SDK, we demonstrate that an API key can be propagated from a Llama Stack client to a MCP tool server.
