    Kagenti is an incubation project building a Kubernetes-based control plane for AI agents. It works with any agent framework and provides modular components that can be deployed independently or as a complete platform, streamlining production deployments for AI Engineers.

    Kagenti is under active development and open to new ideas.

    - title: MCP Gateway
      icon: build
      description: MCP Gateway is an Envoy-based gateway for connecting agents to tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides centralized routing for multiple MCP servers and "virtual MCP servers" that group tools from different sources, enabling precise control over agent tool access and policy enforcement. A Kubernetes-native control plane adds declarative management via custom CRDs, automatic backend discovery through HTTPRoute integration, and Kuadrant support for authorization and token exchange policies.

    - title: Agent Identity and Authorization Guard
      icon: key
      description: Agent Identity and Authorization Guard includes sidecars that provide identity-based, delegated access control for agents to tools, transparent to agent code. They implement agent identity using SPIFFE/SPIRE, dynamic OAuth client registration, token exchange with fine-grained scoping, and secret retrieval from vault for external tool integration. Together they ensure zero-trust security for agents and allow users to precisely control what agents can do on their behalf.

    - title: Kagenti Lifecycle Operators
      icon: smart_toy
      description: Kagenti Lifecycle Operators automate the deployment and management of AI agents and MCP tools on Kubernetes. The Agent Operator handles agents from container images or source code, while the MCP Tool Operator manages tools via Tool Hive. This streamlines the path from development to production with fast, flexible, and reliable automation.
