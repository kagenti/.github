Your PR title must follow the organization-wide enforced rules.
These rules are validated by a required workflow and enforced
via GitHub Repository Rulesets, which can block a PR from merging
if the title does not meet the prefix or formatting requirements.

✔ Allowed prefixes (must be EXACT, case-sensitive):

  Build, Chore, CI, Docs, Feat, Fix, Perf, Refactor, Revert, Style, Test,
  Feature, Bug fix, Proposal, Breaking change, Other/Misc

✔ Formatting rules:

  - Prefix must appear at the **very start** of the title.
  - Prefix must match EXACT CASE (this is enforced by our PR Title
    workflow, which validates exact-match prefixes via the
    `allowed_prefixes` input of the GitHub Action used). [3](https://kitemetric.com/blogs/automate-github-actions-updates-organization-wide-efficiency)
  - Title must be **at least 8 characters long** (enforced by the workflow).
  - Use a colon or a space after the prefix (e.g., `Feat: Add feature`).

If your PR title doesn't meet these rules, the required workflow
will fail and merging will be blocked until fixed.
